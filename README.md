# Discord Friend Finder

TLDR:
This script will compile a list of every user you've sent messages to on Discord in the event that you want to re-add someone but don't remember their username. For example, if you get hacked and they block all of your friends, you can use this as a way to figure out who you were friends with and who you would want to add back. You have to request your data from Discord, place the `friends.py` script in the messages directory of the data folder (called `package`), and run it. All it does is parse the `index.json` folder and output a list of the users you've sent **direct messages** to into a file called `friends.txt` in the same folder.

## Prerequisites

### Request your data from Discord

This is a very straightforward process, but it can take up to 30 days or so for Discord to process your request and send you the download link.
